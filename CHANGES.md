## 1.17.2 (2023-Dec-29)

### Improvements

* **Attribute object accessors**: Added `Element.attribute(String)` and `Attributes.attribute(String)` to more simply
  obtain an `Attribute` object. [2069](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2069)
* **Attribute source tracking**: If source tracking is on, and an Attribute's key is changed (
  via `Attribute.setKey(String)`), the source range is now still tracked
  in `Attribute.sourceRange()`. [2070](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070)
* **Wildcard attribute selector**: Added support for the `[*]` element with any attribute selector. And also restored
  support for selecting by an empty attribute name prefix (`[^]`). [2079](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2079)

### Bug Fixes

* **Mixed-cased source position**: When tracking the source position of attributes, if the source attribute name was
  mix-cased but the parser was lower-case normalizing attribute names, the source position for that attribute was not
  tracked correctly. [2067](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2067)
* **Source position NPE**: When tracking the source position of a body fragment parse, a null pointer
  exception was thrown. [2068](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2068)
* **Multi-point emoji entity**: A multi-point encoded emoji entity may be incorrectly decoded to the replacement
  character. [2074](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2074)
* **Selector sub-expressions**: (Regression) in a selector like `parent [attr=va], other`, the `, OR` was binding
  to `[attr=va]` instead of `parent [attr=va]`, causing incorrect selections. The fix includes a EvaluatorDebug class
  that generates a sexpr to represent the query, allowing simpler and more thorough query parse
  tests. [2073](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2073)
* **XML CData output**: When generating XML-syntax output from parsed HTML, script nodes containing (pseudo) CData
  sections would have an extraneous CData section added, causing script execution errors. Now, the data content is
  emitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData
  section. [2078](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078)
* **Thread safety**: The `:has` evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was
  shared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be
  incorrect. Now, the iterator object is a thread-local. [2088](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2088)
