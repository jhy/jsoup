## Configuration for a CI Fuzz project
## Generated on 2023-07-19

## The build system used to build this project. If not set, cifuzz tries
## to detect the build system automatically.
## Valid values: "bazel", "cmake", "maven", "gradle", "other".
#build-system: cmake

## If the build system type is "other", this command is used by
## `cifuzz run` to build the fuzz test.
#build-command: "make my_fuzz_test"

## Directories containing sample inputs for the code under test.
## See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#corpus
