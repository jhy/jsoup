# jsoup: Java HTML Parser

**jsoup** is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.

**jsoup** implements the [WHATWG HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.

* scrape and [parse](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/input/parse-document-from-string) HTML from a URL, file, or string
* find and [extract data](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax), using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
* manipulate the [HTML elements](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/modifying-data/set-html), attributes, and text
* [clean](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) user-submitted content against a safe-list, to prevent XSS attacks
* output tidy HTML

jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating, to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.

See [**jsoup.org**](https://jsoup.org/) for downloads and the full [API documentation](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/).

## Example
Fetch the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) homepage, parse it to a [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), and select the headlines from the *In the News* section into a list of [Elements](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/index.html?org/jsoup/select/Elements.html):

```java
Document doc = Jsoup.connect("https://en.wikipedia.org/").get();
log(doc.title());
Elements newsHeadlines = doc.select("#mp-itn b a");
for (Element headline : newsHeadlines) {
  log("%s\n\t%s", 
    headline.attr("title"), headline.absUrl("href"));
}
```
